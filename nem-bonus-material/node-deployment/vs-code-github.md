# Uploading to GitHub Using VS Code

1. Open the command palette by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` (`Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) and type `Git Clone` and press `Enter` on the first choice.
2. Choose "Clone from GitHub" and press `Enter`.
3. It will ask you to sign in to your GitHub account and take you to the browser to authenticate.
4. After authenticating, you will see a list of your repositories. Choose _any_ repository, typing a search query to filter the list, and press `Enter`. You may search for and choose abbreviatedman/node-express-mongodb-bonus-material if you want to get the bonus material as part of this process, but our main focus here is getting you authenticated.
5. Choose a folder on your computer where you want to clone the repository and press `Enter`.
6. Now you should be logged in. Confirm by looking at the lower left of your VS Code window: you should see a user icon, and if you click on it, you should see your GitHub username.
7. Open a window with your project in it. Preferably _only_ your project, as it will simplify these steps.
8. Open the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and type `Git: Initialize Repository` and press `Enter`.
9. Open the source control tab on the left sidebar (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + G).
